# Deep Air – A Smart City AI & Synthetic data Digital Twin solving the scalability & data problems


Air pollution is a structural problem that sometimes can be episodic. Today there are several ways to measure air pollution. It can be described through air stations - points with high accuracy - or through satellite sense - e.g., S5p/tropomi with 5 km resolution. It can be described through simulations or even Land Use Regressions models (LURs) - e.g., Lobelia/isglobal.
However, all these methods have drawbacks:

• Air stations are zonal indicators - i.e., not very detailed.

• Satellite sensing has low resolutions.

• Simulations are too complex and require much computational power.

• LURs do not describe urban complexity, which is a fundamental feature. 



Together with 300,000 km/s, a tech-urban start-up located in Barcelona, Davide, and Peter - from now on, we - considered a new scenario to test. As air pollution is a problem of mobility generated by land-use composition, we have tried to predict it using measurements from existing air stations and several features, including but not limited to: urban density, income data, land use composition, building density, dwelling information, and population density and composition.
